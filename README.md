# About Me
I am a public service professional transitioning into the IT and cybersecurity field. With extensive experience in supporting people in customer-facing roles, I bring strong communication skills, problem-solving ability, and a dedication to helping others succeed. Now, I am applying those same strengths to technology.

I hold certifications in ISC2 CC, Google IT Support, and IBM Cybersecurity Analyst, and I am continuing to build hands-on skills in system administration, security fundamentals, and IT support. I am also enrolled in a bachelor’s program for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, in which includes multiple certifications such as: ISC2 CCSP, SSCP, and several CompTIA certifications. My focus is on steady growth, continuous learning, and developing practical solutions that make technology work for people. 

My background in service coordination taught me to guide individuals through complex processes, explain difficult concepts clearly, and remain adaptable under pressure. These strengths align closely with IT roles that require both technical understanding and human-centered problem-solving.

I am seeking opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow – whether in cybersecurity, IT support, or related technology roles. I value integrity, collaboration, and continuous improvement, and I am eager to apply my skills and grow with a team that values integrity, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
